# Avaaz Engineering Exercise

Thanks for your interest in joining Avaaz! We're thrilled that you'd consider working with us. The next step in your interview process is to complete this exercise. The exercise should take no more than an hour to complete.

## Instructions

Your task is to build a solution that allows a user to search data using several filters:

- Date range
- Title
- URL

Using the language and tools of your choice, create a solution that:

- Ingests JSON source data (see the `input` folder)
- Stores normalized data
- Queries the data (using the filters described above)
- Outputs the results

## Evaluation criteria

When reviewing your solution, we will test to see if it:

- Can be run by our engineers using a Docker container
- Solves the challenges laid out in the instructions
- Normalizes the source data, accounting for any variations
- Validates user inputs, accounting for security and accuracy

### Submitting

Fork this repo and submit a pull request with your solution.
